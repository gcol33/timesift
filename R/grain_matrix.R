#' Reduce sensor series to a temporal grain
#'
#' Bins each unit's readings by the calendar and summarises every bin by one or more statistics,
#' returning the array a model is fitted on. The reduction is the choice the package exists to
#' make explicit: `grain` sets how coarse the record becomes, `stats` sets what survives the
#' reduction, and the two are not interchangeable.
#'
#' @param data A data frame of readings in long form, one row per reading.
#' @param id Column identifying the unit carrying the sensor. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param time Column of reading instants, `POSIXct`. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param value Column of readings, numeric. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param grain One of `"native"`, `"halfday"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"season"`,
#'   `"year"`. The four coarse grains follow the calendar, so a bin is a real week or month
#'   rather than a fixed block of hours. Naming several grains returns one representation per
#'   grain, a [timesift_set()]. A function is called on the reading instants and must return
#'   the `POSIXct` start of each reading's bin, which is how a calendar the package does not
#'   carry, such as astronomical seasons, is binned.
#' @param stats Statistics to compute per bin, one channel each, in the order given. See Details.
#' @param year_start `"MM-DD"` boundary of the hydrological year, used by `"season"` and
#'   `"year"`. Defaults to `"09-01"`.
#' @param partial What to do with a bin the record does not cover for its whole calendar span,
#'   which is what a record beginning or ending away from a bin boundary produces. `"keep"`, the
#'   default, returns it alongside the full bins; `"drop"` removes it. See Partial bins.
#'
#' @details
#' Seven statistics are available, and the distinction between an extreme reading, an extreme day
#' and a typical day is deliberate rather than pedantic:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `mean`: arithmetic mean of the readings in the bin.
#'   \item `min`, `max`: coldest and warmest single reading in the bin.
#'   \item `cold_day`, `warm_day`: coldest and warmest day, each day first reduced to its own
#'     mean. Defined for `"day"` and coarser.
#'   \item `mean_daily_min`, `mean_daily_max`: the bin's average daily minimum and average daily
#'     maximum, each day first reduced to its own extreme. Defined for `"day"` and coarser.
#' }
#'
#' An extreme day is a state the unit was in; an extreme reading can be one hour; an average daily
#' extreme is the exposure a typical day of the bin brought. On alpine soil temperature the
#' day-level pair carries more predictive signal than the bin mean, and by more the coarser the
#' bin.
#'
#' Whether a grain is a day or coarser is decided from the bins rather than from the grain's
#' name, so a supplied calendar that cuts inside a day is refused for these four as well, naming
#' the day it splits.
#'
#' Nothing is standardised here. Scaling belongs to the fold it is computed on, never to the
#' representation, because computing it over all units would leak held-out units into the input.
#'
#' @section Time zone:
#' Bins follow the calendar the series is carried in, which is the `tzone` attribute of `time`;
#' a column with none is read as UTC, and a name the zone database does not know is an error. The
#' zone is resolved once, at the edge: below it the binning works in local time, where a day is
#' 86400 seconds whatever the night did, so a zone that moves its clock at midnight has no
#' midnight to lose. A bin start is a local time, so reporting it back as an instant needs a rule:
#' one the clock skipped resolves to the instant the clock jumped to, one the clock repeated to
#' the first of the two. Instants are read at whole seconds.
#'
#' The `"native"` grain is the one grain not read on that clock: its bin is the reading itself,
#' so the two readings of an hour a zone repeats are two bins, and the record read at `"native"`
#' is the same array whichever zone it is carried in.
#'
#' @section Bins that do not tile the record:
#' Every unit must reach every bin, and consecutive bins must be one bin apart on the grain's own
#' calendar. A bin no unit reaches is never built, so a month missing from the whole record would
#' otherwise pass as four adjacent monthly bins with one simply gone. Neither the `"native"` grain,
#' whose bin is the reading itself, nor a supplied calendar, which declares its own bin lengths,
#' is held to the second rule. [coverage()] lays the same binning out as a count of readings per
#' unit and bin, which is where a refused record's gaps are read off.
#'
#' @section Partial bins:
#' A bin is partial when the record does not cover its whole calendar span. Which bins those are
#' follows from where the record starts and stops against the calendar, not from the grain alone:
#' three years of hourly readings from 1 September carry no partial month and no partial season on
#' a `"09-01"` boundary, but the same record carries a partial week at each end, because 1
#' September is a Wednesday. A record from an arbitrary deployment date carries one at each end of
#' almost every grain.
#'
#' A bin is partial if its start precedes the first reading of the record, or if its calendar span
#' runs past the last reading plus the record's own sampling interval, taken as the smallest gap
#' between consecutive distinct reading instants. Only a bin at an end of the record can satisfy
#' either, because every unit is required to span every bin in between. The verdict is returned as
#' the `bin_partial` attribute whichever way `partial` is set, so a kept partial bin is labelled
#' rather than silent.
#'
#' Keeping partial bins is the default because dropping them discards the record's ends: on a
#' seasonal grain that is up to three months of readings at each end. The cost of keeping them is
#' that such a bin's mean is taken over fewer readings and its extremes over fewer days, so
#' `cold_day` and `warm_day` there are drawn from a shorter draw and sit closer to the bin mean
#' than a full bin's would. `bin_n` gives the count the bin was actually reduced from.
#'
#' A caller-supplied binning declares its own bins, so the package cannot know where the last one
#' was meant to end and takes the record's end as its end. Such a final bin is never reported
#' partial; its leading bin is judged as any other.
#'
#' @return A numeric array of shape `[unit, bin, channel]`, with dimnames giving the sorted unit
#'   identifiers, the ISO-8601 start of each bin, and the statistic names. Attributes:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `grain`: the grain name.
#'     \item `stats`: the statistic names in channel order.
#'     \item `year_start`: the boundary used.
#'     \item `bin_start`: the instant each bin begins on the calendar, which is earlier
#'       than the bin's first reading wherever the record does not reach the boundary.
#'     \item `bin_end`: the last reading instant assigned to each bin.
#'     \item `bin_n`: a `[unit, bin]` matrix of how many readings fell in each bin.
#'     \item `bin_partial`: a logical vector marking the bins the record does not cover for their
#'       whole calendar span.
#'   }
#'   Naming more than one grain returns a [timesift_set()] of those arrays.
