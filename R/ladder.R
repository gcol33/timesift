#' Fit at every grain and see where skill saturates
#'
#' Cross-validates every learner at every grain of a representation set, on one fold map and one
#' mask of scorable cells, and returns the score of each `(grain, learner, variable, fold)` cell.
#' It is the measurement the package exists for: how much of a record a model needs, read off the
#' point where making the record finer stops paying.
#'
#' Every arm sees identical splits and is restricted to identical cells, so the arms' means share a
#' denominator and any two of them can be compared cell by cell with [paired_contrast()].
#'
#' @param x A [grain_matrix()] result, a [timesift_set()], or a named list of representations.
#' @param y The response for the same units.
#' @param learners A learner, a set of them from [c()], a list, or names of registered ones. An
#'   unnamed set is labelled by each learner's own name.
#' @param folds A fold map from [fold_map()], or any named integer vector. Built with the defaults
#'   of [fold_map()] when not given.
#' @param response Name of the registered response head.
#' @param metric Name of a registered metric, or a function of `(y, p)`, or `NULL` for the
#'   response head's own. Whichever it is, it travels with the fit and is what every later
#'   rescoring reads; a function is reported as `<function>`.
#' @param control [train_control()], the training settings every neural learner of the ladder
#'   reads. A learner carrying a control of its own overrides it on the settings that control
#'   names.
#' @param keep_fits Keep every per-fold fitted model, which is what lets [occlusion()] read a
#'   fitted model without refitting it.
#' @param verbose Report each arm and each fold as it runs.
#' @param ... Ignored, so that `summary()` takes the arguments its generic declares.
#'
#' @return A data frame of one row per scored cell, of class `timesift_ladder`, carrying the
#'   grain, the learner, the variable, the fold and the score. The held-out prediction of every
#'   unit is kept in the `predictions` attribute, and the scorable-cell mask in `cells`.
