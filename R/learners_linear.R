#' Penalised regression on the flattened representation
#'
#' One elastic net per variable, over every bin-by-channel column of the representation and, by
#' default, their squares. There is no discrete selection step: the penalty path uses every column
#' and shrinks, and the penalty itself is chosen by an inner cross-validation on the fitting units,
#' so nothing about the model is decided outside the fold it is fitted in.
#'
#' The family is the response head's: a binary cross-entropy loss fits a logistic model and a
#' squared-error loss a linear one, so the learner is the same under a presence-absence head and
#' under a continuous one. So are the case weights: the head's `weights`, [positive_weights()]
#' for presence-absence, are what every learner that ships fits under.
#'
#' The inner folds are dealt for each response and stratified on it, so a rare outcome is spread
#' over them as evenly as its count allows. A presence-absence response whose inner training sets
#' cannot each hold two of each outcome, the fewest a logistic path is fitted to, has too few of
#' one outcome to choose a penalty on. It is predicted its share among the fitting units, as a
#' response holding one outcome is, and the fit names every such response in `unfitted`.
#'
#' This is the aggregate-feature side of the comparison the package was built for, and it is the
#' fair opponent for a network: a per-fold discrete selector pays selection variance a network
#' never pays, so beating that one is not a matched result.
#'
#' @param data A representation the learner is pinned to, or `NULL` to run across every
#'   representation of the run.
#' @param alpha Elastic-net mixing, `1` lasso and `0` ridge.
#' @param n_inner Folds of the inner cross-validation that chooses the penalty.
#' @param squares Add the square of every column, giving the same quadratic capacity a
#'   second-order polynomial term would.
#' @param s Which penalty of the inner path to predict at.
#' @param seed Seed for the inner cross-validation's fold draw, which is random and would otherwise
#'   make the fit irreproducible.

#' Forward selection by AIC on the flattened representation
#'
#' One generalised linear model per variable, its predictors chosen by forward selection over every
#' bin-by-channel column, admitting a column while it lowers AIC and stopping at a fixed budget.
#' Each candidate enters as an orthogonal polynomial, so a term can be non-monotone in the reading
#' the way a niche optimum is. The family is the response head's: logistic under a binary
#' cross-entropy loss, Gaussian under a squared-error one. So are the case weights, so a rare
#' response weighs here what it weighs in every other learner.
#'
#' Selection happens inside whichever units the learner is handed, so under [grain_ladder()] it is
#' redone in every fold. That is the footing the other learners are fitted on. Reported beside a
#' penalised fit it also prices discrete selection: choosing a handful of columns out of hundreds
#' is high variance, and that variance is a cost of the selector rather than of the features.
