#' Reduce sensor series to a lookback anchored on each target
#'
#' Reads, for every target, a fixed length of record ending a fixed lag before that target's own
#' instant, and summarises it by one or more statistics. It is the reduction a calendar cannot
#' express: two targets on the same unit a fortnight apart read two different stretches of the same
#' series, so the bins are relative to the target rather than to a month or a week.
#'
#' @param data A data frame of readings in long form, one row per reading.
#' @param id Column identifying the unit carrying the sensor. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param time Column of reading instants, `POSIXct`. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param value Column of readings, numeric. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param at A data frame of targets with an `id` column naming the unit and an `at` column of
#'   anchor instants, `POSIXct`. One row per target; a unit may carry any number of them. The
#'   columns are read by name, as every alignment in the package is.
#' @param span The lookback's length, as a duration. See Durations.
#' @param lag The gap between the anchor and the end of the lookback, as a duration. Defaults to
#'   `"0 days"`, which ends the lookback at the anchor itself.
#' @param bins How many sub-bins the lookback is cut into, oldest first. `span` must divide by it
#'   exactly. One bin gives a block of features; several give a sequence a convolution can read.
#' @param stats Statistics to compute per bin, one channel each, in the order given. The same seven
#'   [grain_matrix()] carries.
#'
#' @details
#' Bin `b` of a target anchored at `a` covers `[a - lag - span + b * step, a - lag - span +
#' (b + 1) * step)`, with `step` the lookback's length divided by `bins` and `b` counted from zero.
#' The interval is closed at the left and open at the right, so a reading on a boundary belongs to
#' the later bin, and only the readings of the target's own unit are read.
#'
#' Every `(target, bin)` cell must hold at least one reading. A lookback reaching past either end of
#' the record is an error naming the target and the interval, never a padded row: an invented value
#' in front of a model is worse than a target the record cannot answer for.
#'
#' The four day-level statistics reduce each calendar day first, so they are defined only where
#' every day lies whole inside one bin. For a lookback that is two conditions rather than one:
#' `step` must be a whole number of days, and `a - lag - span` must fall on a day boundary. Either
#' failing is an error naming the target.
#'
#' @section Durations:
#' `span` and `lag` are read from a count and a unit -- `"30 days"`, `"12 hours"`, `"1 year"` --
#' or from a bare number of seconds. A **year is 365 days and a month is 30 days** here. A lookback
#' of a fixed length is a fixed length, not a calendar step: the point of anchoring on the target
#' is that every target reads the same amount of record, which a February and a leap year would
#' take away. Where the calendar is what matters, [grain_matrix()] is the call that follows it.
#'
#' The units are `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months` and `years`, singular or
#' plural.
#'
#' @section Time zone:
#' The calendar is the series', taken from the `tzone` attribute of `time` as [grain_matrix()]
#' takes it; a column with none is read as UTC. The anchors are instants and are read as a clock in
#' that same calendar, whatever zone `at` carries, so one record is binned by one calendar.
#'
#' @return A numeric array of shape `[target, bin, channel]`, of class `timesift_matrix`. Its rows
#'   are the rows of `at`, in `at`'s own order, named by `at`'s row names where it carries them and
#'   by position where it does not. Its bins are named by where each one opens relative to the
#'   anchor, oldest first, and its channels by the statistic. Attributes:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `grain`: `"lookback"`.
#'     \item `span`, `lag`: the durations, resolved to seconds.
#'     \item `bins`: how many bins the lookback was cut into.
#'     \item `stats`: the statistic names in channel order.
#'     \item `bin_n`: a `[target, bin]` matrix of how many readings fell in each cell.
#'   }
#'
#' @seealso [grain_matrix()], the reduction that follows the calendar instead.
