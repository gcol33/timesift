#' What part of the record a fitted model reads
#'
#' Holds one bin of the record back at a time, rescores the held-out units, and records the fall in
#' score as that bin's weight. Nothing is refitted: the models kept by
#' `grain_ladder(keep_fits = TRUE)` are the ones read, so the profile describes the models that
#' produced the reported scores rather than a fresh set of them.
#'
#' A model has to be shown something in place of a held-back bin, and what it is shown decides what
#' the weight means. Permuting the bin's values across units keeps the observed readings exactly
#' and cuts only the link between a reading and its unit. Replacing every unit by the fitting-fold
#' mean removes all between-unit variation while keeping the shape of the year. Replacing the bin
#' by each unit's own mean over the record keeps how warm a unit is and removes only that bin's
#' departure from it.
#'
#' Read with `over = "channel"` the same machinery asks what each statistic of a grain carries,
#' holding one channel back across the whole record instead of one bin across all channels.
#'
#' @param x A [timesift()] fit, or a [grain_ladder()] result, in either case fitted with
#'   `keep_fits = TRUE`.
#' @param data The representation set the ladder was fitted on.
#' @param y The response it was fitted to.
#' @param arm The arm to read, as `"grain|learner"` or `"learner"`.
#' @param ... Passed to the method.
#' @param over `"bin"` to hold each bin back in turn, `"channel"` for each channel.
#' @param substitute What a held-back part is replaced by: `"permute"`, `"fold_mean"` or
#'   `"unit_mean"`.
#' @param metric Name of the registered metric the rescoring is read by, or a function of
#'   `(y, p)`. Left unset it is the one the fit was scored under, so a weight is a fall in the
#'   number [summary()] reports rather than in a second one. `"roc_auc"` is usually the steadier
#'   reading over many rescorings: it responds to every reordering of the units, where a maximum
#'   over thresholds frequently does not move at all.
#' @param permutations Draws averaged over, for `substitute = "permute"`.
#' @param seed Random seed.
#'
#' @return A data frame of one row per held-back part and variable, carrying the mean weight over
#'   folds and the score with and without the part.
