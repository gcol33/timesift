#' Compare two arms cell by cell
#'
#' Two arms scored on the same held-out units do not necessarily have the same set of defined
#' cells, so a difference of two marginal means is not a difference between the arms. This takes
#' the difference inside each `(variable, fold)` cell both arms scored, averages it within a
#' variable over its folds, and summarises those per-variable means, the variables being the
#' independent replicates.
#'
#' Pairing also cancels what a threshold-selected metric carries in its level. TSS read at the
#' threshold that maximises it is biased upward where presences are thin, both arms carry the same
#' bias on the same cell, and it cancels in the difference. That is why the levels a ladder reports
#' are upper bounds while the differences between arms are read at face value.
#'
#' An arm is named whole, by its grain and its learner. A learner named alone would have to take
#' its best grain, and that grain is chosen on the held-out scores the contrast is then read off:
#' the difference becomes one between two maxima, favouring whichever learner ran across more
#' grains, and neither the interval nor the p-value accounts for the choice. It is the mechanism
#' [tss_inflation()] measures one level down, and here pairing does not cancel it.
#' [select_grain()] chooses a grain on inner folds instead, and its `compare` argument contrasts
#' the selection with the arms of a ladder on matched cells.
#'
#' @param ladder A [grain_ladder()] result.
#' @param a,b The two arms, each named `"grain|learner"`.
#' @param interval Which interval the row carries. `"variables"` is the spread across the response
#'   variables of this dataset. `"nested_cv"` is an interval for the difference in the two arms'
#'   risk on a new sample, by the nested cross-validation of Bates, Hastie and Tibshirani (2024)
#'   read on the difference of the two arms' cell scores, which needs a ladder fitted with
#'   `grain_ladder(interval = "nested_cv")`. The paper gives the estimator for one procedure's
#'   error and names the difference between two as an extension; the identity its estimator rests
#'   on is on the difference of two losses as much as on one.

#'   cells and variables it rests on; a Wilcoxon signed-rank p-value; and `p_method`, `"exact"` where the p-value is
#'   read off the exact distribution and `"normal"` where it is the normal approximation with
#'   continuity and tie corrections, which it is when the per-variable differences hold a zero or
#'   a tie or number fifty or more.

#' How much a self-selected threshold inflates the reported level

#' units the score is then read on. That selection inflates the level, and by more the fewer
#' presences a cell holds. Most code carries the inflation silently; this measures it for the

#' planted is the inflation.

#' What population skill a reported level is consistent with
