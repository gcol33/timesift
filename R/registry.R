#' Register a metric
#'
#' A metric scores one held-out cell: the observed response of the units in a fold and a model's
#' predictions for them. Registering one makes it available to [grain_ladder()] by name, with no
#' change to the fitting code.
#'
#' @param name Name the metric is asked for by.
#' @param fn A function of `(y, p)`, the observed values and the predictions for one cell, both
#'   vectors of the same length, returning one number or `NA` where the cell defines none.
#' @param overwrite Replace an existing registration.
#'
#' @return The registered function, invisibly.
#'
#' @examples
#' register_metric("hit_rate", function(y, p) mean((p >= 0.5) == (y == 1)), overwrite = TRUE)

# A metric reaches a run either as a registered name or as a function of (y, p), and everything
# that rescores afterwards -- the ensemble row of a report, an occlusion profile -- needs the
# function rather than a name to look up again. Both travel with the fit: the function is what
# scores, the name is what the report prints. A function has no name to print, and reads as
# `<function>` on both sides rather than as whatever the language calls an anonymous one.

#' Register a response head
#'
#' A response head says what the values being predicted are, how they reach a learner, and which
#' cells of the (variable, fold) grid a score is defined on. Presence-absence with a joint
#' multi-label head is what ships; an abundance or phenology response is a registration rather than
#' a second fitting path.
#'
#' @param name Name the response is asked for by.
#' @param spec A list with elements `prepare(y)`, returning the numeric matrix a learner is fitted
#'   on; `activation`, the name of the output transform (`"sigmoid"` or `"identity"`); `loss`, the
#'   name of the training objective (`"binary_cross_entropy"` or `"squared_error"`); `metric`, the
#'   default metric name; and `cells(y, folds)`, returning the mask of scorable cells. Every
#'   learner that ships reads `loss` and `activation` from here: the encoders train under the loss
#'   and predict through the activation, and the learners fitting one model per response take the
#'   family the loss names, logistic or Gaussian. The combiner minimises the same loss.
#' @param overwrite Replace an existing registration.
#'
#' @return The registered specification, invisibly.
