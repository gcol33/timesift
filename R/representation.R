#' How a series becomes an array a learner reads
#'
#' A representation is the reduction the package exists to make explicit: the record unreduced,
#' the record at a calendar grain, several grains bound into one block of features, or a lookback
#' of fixed length ending at each target's own instant. It carries the settings and nothing else,
#' so the same object describes a representation before any record has been seen, names the arm it
#' produced in a fitted object, and rebuilds itself for new targets in [predict.timesift()].
#'
#' @param grain One of `"native"`, `"halfday"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"season"`,
#'   `"year"`, or a function of the reading instants returning each reading's bin start. See
#'   [grain_matrix()].
#' @param grains Grains bound side by side into one block, or `NULL` for the automatic set
#'   [grains()] describes.
#' @param stats Statistics computed per bin, one channel each, in the order given. See
#'   [grain_matrix()] for the seven and for what separates an extreme reading from an extreme day.
#' @param year_start `"MM-DD"` boundary of the hydrological year, used by `"season"` and `"year"`.
#' @param span The lookback's length, as a duration such as `"30 days"` or a number of seconds.
#'   See [lookback_matrix()] for how a duration is read.
#' @param lag The gap between a target's instant and the end of its lookback.
#' @param bins Sub-bins the lookback is cut into, oldest first. One gives a block of features,
#'   several give a sequence.
#'
#' @details
#' Every representation carries `label`, the name it is reported under; `kind`, one of `"grain"`,
#' `"multigrain"` and `"lookback"`; the settings its kind uses; and `sequence`, which says whether
#' its bins are ordered in time and so mean something to a convolution. `native()`, `grain()` and a
#' `lookback()` of more than one bin are sequences; `multigrain()` and a one-bin `lookback()` are
#' blocks of features.
#'
#' `multigrain()` flattens each of its grains to one row per target and puts them side by side, so
#' a column of the block names the grain, the statistic and the bin it came from. It is the
#' tabular representation a penalised regression or a random forest reads.
#'
#' @return A `timesift_representation`.
