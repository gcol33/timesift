#' Which cells a score is defined on
#'
#' A per-variable score needs both classes among the held-out units, and a per-variable model needs
#' both classes among the units it was fitted on, so a `(variable, fold)` cell where either side of
#' the split is one-class carries no score. The mask says which cells those are.
#'
#' It is computed from the response and the fold map alone, with no model involved. Every learner
#' in a ladder is then restricted to the same cells, so their means share one denominator and every
#' paired difference runs on matched cells. Computing it from a model instead would let a joint
#' multi-label learner, which emits a number for every cell whether or not it could be fitted per
#' variable, be scored on cells its opponents were never fitted on.
#'
#' @inheritParams fold_map
#' @param folds A fold map from [fold_map()], or any named integer vector of the same shape.
#'
#' @return A data frame of one row per `(variable, fold)` cell, of class `timesift_cells`, with
#'   the counts on each side of the split and a `scorable` flag.

#' Case weights that balance a rare response
#'
#' The weight every learner that ships fits a presence-absence response under: each presence of a
#' response weighs the ratio of absences to presences among the units handed in, capped, and each
#' absence weighs one. A response with a presence in one target of a hundred is otherwise fitted
#' away by any learner that minimises a mean loss, and the encoders, the penalised fit, the forest
#' and the forward search would each have to decide that for themselves.
#'
#' The weights are the response head's: the shipped presence-absence head carries this function
#' as its `weights`, and a head registered with `weights = function(y) positive_weights(y, cap =
#' 20)` weights every learner by that cap instead. A head without `weights` is fitted unweighted.
