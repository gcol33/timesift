#' Choose the grain inside the training data, and score the whole procedure
#'
#' [grain_ladder()] fits every candidate against one fold map and reports the grid, so reading the
#' best grain off it and quoting that grain's score quotes a number the held-out units helped
#' choose. This does the choosing inside the training data instead. Within each outer fold the
#' training units are split again, every candidate is fitted on part of them and scored on the rest,
#' the best is refitted on the whole outer training set, and the outer test fold is predicted once.
#' The estimate that comes back is therefore of the procedure including its choice of grain, which
#' is what an ecologist applying it to a new site would run.
#'
#' A candidate is a `(grain, learner)` pair: the grains are the elements of the representation set,
#' which is where a grain and the statistic its grains are summarised by are both named, and the
#' learners are the ones passed. Both are registry entries or objects built by [learner()], so a new
#' grain, a new grain summary or a new candidate model widens the search with no change here.
#'
#' What the estimate is of: the expected held-out score of the whole pipeline, selection included,
#' on units drawn as these were. What it is not: the score of the winning grain. That is higher, by
#' the amount selection buys itself, and the difference between the two is the quantity this
#' function exists to keep out of a reported number. It also does not say the selected grain is the
#' one a mechanism acts at; it says that grain predicted best on the units the selector saw.
#'
#' The cost is the ladder's, multiplied by the number of inner folds: `v_outer * (v_inner *
#' candidates + 1)` fits. With a neural learner that is where an overnight run goes.
#'
#' @section Choosing a candidate:
#' Inside each outer fold every candidate carries an inner score, the mean over variables of its
#' per-variable mean over the inner folds, and a standard error, the standard deviation over the
#' inner folds of the fold's own score (the mean over the variables scored in that fold) divided by
#' the square root of the number of inner folds. `rule = "argmax"` takes the highest inner score,
#' and on an exact tie the candidate declared first.
#'
#' `rule = "coarsest_adequate"` first finds that highest score and its standard error, calls every
#' candidate scoring at least the highest minus one standard error adequate, and takes the coarsest
#' adequate one. Coarseness is read off the representation as the package holds it: fewer bins is
#' coarser, and between two candidates with the same number of bins, fewer channels is coarser.
#' A tie on both goes to the higher inner score, then to the candidate declared first. Where one
#' candidate scores more than a standard error above every other, the two rules agree; where the
#' inner profile is flat, this one returns the least storage the record can be kept at without a
#' measured loss inside the training data. A standard error that cannot be computed, because a
#' candidate was scored in fewer than two inner folds, is taken as zero, so the rule falls back to
#' the candidates tied with the highest score.
#'
#' @section What the interval is for:
#' The across-variable interval, the one every level of the package reports, is the estimate plus
#' or minus a Student's t quantile times the standard error across the response variables. Its
#' spread is the spread of true skill between variables, and it cannot see the error every
#' variable shares, since all of them are fitted and scored on the same units and the same folds.
#' It is an interval over the variables of this dataset, and not an interval for what the
#' procedure would score on a new sample.
#'
#' `interval = "nested_cv"` adds one that is, by the nested cross-validation of Bates, Hastie and
#' Tibshirani (2024). Inside every repetition, each outer training set is cross-validated again
#' over the remaining folds of the same map, which gives the mean squared error of a
#' cross-validation estimate as the difference of two terms it can estimate: the squared gap
#' between the inner estimate and the held-out fold's score, less the variance of that fold's
#' score. The paper's error is a mean of per-unit losses; here a fold's score is the mean over the
#' variables scorable in it, the inner estimate is averaged as the reported estimate is, and the
#' variance of a fold's score is its delete-one jackknife variance over the units of the fold,
#' which for a mean of per-unit losses is exactly the paper's `var(e) / |I_k|`. The square root of
#' the estimated mean squared error is held between the jackknife standard error of the estimate
#' and the square root of the fold count times it, as the paper's section 4.3.2 has it, and the
#' centre carries its bias correction, so the interval is for the risk of the procedure fitted on
#' a sample of this size, which is the fit `final` holds.
#'
#' The cost is the selection's, multiplied: one repetition fits the procedure once for every
#' unordered pair of outer folds, `v_outer * (v_outer - 1) / 2` fits, and every repetition after
#' the first refits the outer folds as well. More repetitions steady the estimate of the mean
#' squared error; the paper uses two hundred random splits, which is affordable where a fit is
#' cheap and is not where a fit is a neural network.

#' @section A cut learned inside the training data:
#' TSS read at the cut that maximises it on the scored units is biased upward, most where presences
#' are few ([tss_inflation()]). With `threshold` set, each outer fold learns one cut per variable
#' on the inner out-of-fold predictions of the candidate it selected, which the inner search has
#' already made for every outer training unit, by [decision_threshold()] under the rule named. The
#' cut is then frozen and the outer test fold's predictions are read at it by [tss()]. No unit of
#' an outer test fold enters the cut its own fold is read at. The inner out-of-fold predictions
#' come from models fitted on part of the outer training set and the held-out predictions from
#' the refit on all of it, so the cut is learned on predictions of the same candidate from slightly
#' smaller training sets.
#'
#' @param x A [grain_matrix()] result, a [timesift_set()], or a named list of representations.
#'   Its names are the grains being chosen between.
#' @param y The response for the same units.
#' @param learners A learner, a list of them, or names of registered ones, as [grain_ladder()]
#'   takes. Named alongside the grains they form the candidate set.
#' @param folds The outer fold map, from [fold_map()] or any named integer vector. Built with the
#'   defaults of [fold_map()] when not given.
#' @param inner Number of inner folds the selection is made on, or a function of the outer training
#'   response returning a fold map for those units. A count deals the inner folds by the grouping
#'   the outer fold map carries, so what [grouped_cv()] kept whole outside stays whole inside.
#' @param rule How a candidate is chosen from its inner scores. `"argmax"` takes the highest.
#'   `"coarsest_adequate"` takes the coarsest candidate whose inner score lies within one standard
#'   error of the highest, the one-standard-error rule of Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone
#'   (1984) and of Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2009, section 7.10) with coarseness in place of
#'   model complexity. See Choosing a candidate.
#' @param threshold `NULL`, or the rule of [decision_threshold()] a presence-absence cut is learned
#'   by: `"youden"`, the cut that maximises TSS, `"kappa"` or `"prevalence"`. See A cut learned
#'   inside the training data.
#' @param interval Which interval to report beside the across-variable one, which is always
#'   reported: `"variables"` for that one alone, or `"nested_cv"` for an interval for the
#'   procedure's risk. See What the interval is for.
#' @param repeats Repetitions of the nested cross-validation, each on its own fold map. The first
#'   is the map the estimate was computed on.
#' @param response Name of the registered response head.
#' @param metric Name of a registered metric the selection is made on, or `NULL` for the
#'   response's own. The estimate is reported under every registered metric whichever this is.
#' @param compare A [grain_ladder()] result on the same units, response and outer fold map, whose
#'   arms the selected procedure is contrasted against cell by cell. `NULL` for no contrast.
#' @param control [train_control()], the training settings every neural learner reads, in the
#'   inner search and in the refit alike. A learner carrying a control of its own overrides it on
#'   the settings that control names.
#' @param seed Seed for the inner splits. Each outer fold splits under `seed` plus its own number,
#'   so no two outer folds inherit the same inner partition.
#' @param verbose Report each outer fold and what it selected as it runs.
#'
#' @return A `timesift_selection`: a list carrying `selected`, one row per outer fold with the
#'   candidate it chose, the inner score it chose on, the highest inner score in that fold
#'   (`inner_best`) and that score's standard error (`inner_se`); `estimate`, the nested score under every
#'   registered metric with its standard error across variables; `contrast`, one
#'   [paired_contrast()] row against each arm of `compare`, or `NULL`; `candidates`, the set that
#'   was searched; and `scores`, the per-cell rows of the selected procedure under the selection
#'   metric, in the layout [grain_ladder()] returns. The held-out prediction of every unit is in
#'   the `predictions` attribute and the scorable-cell mask in `cells`. `inner` holds every
#'   candidate's inner score and standard error in every outer fold. With `threshold` set, the
#'   estimate carries the score, its interval and the interval's name in `interval`, one row per
#'   metric and interval. With `interval = "nested_cv"` it also carries `nested_cv`, the same rows
#'   with the estimator's own quantities beside them, and `final`, the procedure fitted on every
#'   unit, whose risk that interval is for. With `threshold` set, the
#'   estimate carries one further row, `tss_inner_cut`, the procedure's TSS at the learned cuts;
#'   `thresholds` holds the cut of every outer fold and variable; and `cut_scores` the per-cell
#'   rows it is averaged from, in the layout of `scores`. Both are `NULL` otherwise.
#'
#' @seealso [grain_ladder()] for the grid this selects from, and [paired_contrast()] for the
#'   comparison the `contrast` element holds.
