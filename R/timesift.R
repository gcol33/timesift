#' Fit and compare representations of time-varying data
#'
#' One call from two tables to a scored comparison and a held-out estimate of choosing among it.
#' `targets` is one row per thing to predict and `series` is the long, time-stamped record belonging
#' to those rows. Every representation in `sift` is built and every learner in `models` is paired
#' with the ones it can read; each pair is a candidate.
#'
#' Within each outer fold of `resampling` the training targets are split again into `inner` folds.
#' Every candidate is cross-validated on that inner split, the rule picks one on its inner score,
#' and the stack's weights are fitted on the inner out-of-fold predictions. Every candidate is then
#' refitted on the whole outer training set and predicts the outer test fold, and the selected
#' candidate's prediction and the prediction combined under that fold's weights are kept. Nothing
#' the outer test fold holds enters the choice or the weights it is scored under, so `estimate` is
#' of the procedure, selection and stacking included, which is what an ecologist applying it to a
#' new site would run.
#'
#' The same refits give every candidate an out-of-fold prediction on the outer folds, and `scores`
#' holds those. They say where predictive skill saturates as the record is read more coarsely, which
#' is the measurement the package exists for, but the highest of them is a number the held-out
#' targets helped choose: read the candidates for the shape of the comparison and `estimate` for
#' the level. With `inner = NULL` no inner search is run, the candidates are compared on the outer
#' folds alone and no estimate is made.
#'
#' The cost is `v_outer * (v_inner + 1) * candidates` fits for the evaluation and one refit per
#' candidate on every target, against `v_outer * candidates` for the comparison alone.
#'
#' @param targets A data frame, one row per prediction target.
#' @param series A long data frame of readings, or `NULL` to fit on `static` alone.
#' @param y Columns of `targets` holding the response, as a tidyselect expression such as
#'   `starts_with("sp_")`.
#' @param x Columns of `series` holding the readings, as a tidyselect expression. Defaults to
#'   every numeric column but `id` and `time`.
#' @param id Column naming the unit, present in both tables. A bare column name or a string.
#' @param time Column of reading instants in `series`, `POSIXct`.
#' @param target_time Column of `targets` anchoring each row in time, `POSIXct`. Optional, and
#'   what a unit carrying several targets through time needs.
#' @param static Columns of `targets` carried alongside the representation, as a tidyselect
#'   expression. None by default.
#' @param models A learner, a set of them from [c()], or a list. Defaults to [elasticnet()].
#' @param sift The representations a learner without a `data =` of its own is run across.
#'   A [grains()] or [lookbacks()] set, a set from [c()], a bare vector of grain names, a single
#'   representation, or a list of them. Defaults to `grains("auto")`.
#' @param ensemble `TRUE` for the default stack, `FALSE` for none, or an [ensemble()] spec.
#' @param resampling The outer split: [cv()], [grouped_cv()], a fold vector, or a [fold_map()]
#'   result.
#' @param inner Number of inner folds the choice and the stack's weights are made on inside each
#'   outer training set, a function of the outer training response returning a fold map for those
#'   targets, or `NULL` to compare the candidates on the outer folds without an estimate. A count
#'   deals the inner folds by the grouping the outer split carries, as [select_grain()] does.
#' @param rule How a candidate is chosen from its inner scores, `"argmax"` or
#'   `"coarsest_adequate"`, as in [select_grain()].
#' @param response Name of the registered response head.
#' @param metric Name of a registered metric, or a function of `(y, p)`, or `NULL` for the
#'   response head's own. It is what the candidates are chosen on and what the report reads.
#'   Whichever it is, it travels with the fit and is what every later rescoring reads; a function is
#'   reported as `<function>`. The estimate is also reported under every registered metric.
#' @param control [train_control()], the training settings every neural learner reads.
#' @param keep_fits Keep every per-fold fitted candidate beside the refits.
#' @param seed Seed for the inner splits. Each outer fold splits under `seed` plus its position.
#' @param verbose Report each outer fold as it runs.
#'
#' @section Rules the entry point enforces:
#' `static` is never implicit: a column of `targets` that is neither the response, the identifier
#' nor the anchor is ignored unless `static` names it, because a predictor nobody asked for is
#' worse than one that is missing.
#'
#' One target row per `id`, unless `target_time` says where in time each row sits. Repeated
#' identifiers without an anchor are an error naming them.
#'
#' With `target_time`, every representation has to be anchored on the target, so [native()],
#' [grain()] and [multigrain()] are refused and `sift` must be given as [lookbacks()]. There is no
#' default set of spans, because there is no defensible one.
#'
#' Without `series`, `static` is the whole predictor block and `sift` is ignored.
#'
#' @section What a learner may be handed:
#' A learner declares whether it reads a tabular block or a sequence. A tabular learner given
#' [native()] is refused before anything is built, and a sequence learner given a representation of
#' one bin is refused once the array says how many bins it has. Inside a `sift` expansion such a
#' pair is skipped and reported once by name; named explicitly through a learner's `data =` it is
#' an error.
#'
#' @return A `timesift` object, a list carrying:
#'   * `estimate`: the held-out score of the selected candidate (`arm = "selected"`) and of the
#'     stack (`arm = "ensemble"`), one row per metric, with the standard error and the 95% interval
#'     across response variables. An interval across the variables of this dataset, not one for a
#'     new sample: every variable is fitted and scored on the same targets and folds, so the error
#'     they share is not in it. `NULL` with `inner = NULL`.
#'   * `selected`: one row per outer fold, the candidate it chose, the inner score it chose on, the
#'     highest inner score and that score's standard error; `inner`: every candidate's inner score
#'     in every outer fold; `fold_weights`: the stack's weights in every outer fold, one row per
#'     fold. All `NULL` with `inner = NULL`.
#'   * `predictions`: the held-out prediction of every target under the selected candidate and under
#'     the stack.
#'   * `candidates`, `scores` and `oof`: every candidate, its per-cell scores on the outer folds and
#'     its outer out-of-fold predictions.
#'   * `choice`, `models`, `stack` and `weights`: the procedure applied to every target, which is
#'     what [predict()] uses. Every candidate is refitted on all of them; `choice` is the candidate
#'     the rule takes on the outer scores, with the outer folds as the split it chooses on, and
#'     `stack` holds weights fitted on the outer out-of-fold predictions.
#'   * `representations`, `fits`, `folds`, `cells`, `y`, and the `metric`, `response`, `spec` and
#'     `call` it was asked for.
