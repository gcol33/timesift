# Where in the year, or the day, each bin sits

An encoder that ends in global pooling discards when a thermal event
happened, so the position of a bin in the year has to be given to it as
input if it is to be used at all. These channels carry that position as
the sine and cosine of the bin's fractional place in the year, which is
continuous across the turn of the year where the fraction itself is not.
On a record read finer than a day, the same pair for the place in the
day carries where a reading sits in the daily cycle.

## Usage

``` r
calendar_channels(x, cycles = "year")
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A
  [`grain_matrix()`](https://gillescolling.com/timesift/reference/grain_matrix.md)
  result. A
  [`lookback_matrix()`](https://gillescolling.com/timesift/reference/lookback_matrix.md)
  result has no place in the calendar and is refused.

- cycles:

  Which cycles to place each bin in, `"year"`, `"day"` or both, in the
  order given. The day cycle reads bins that sit less than a day apart;
  at a day or coarser every bin would sit at the same place in the day,
  and it is refused.

## Value

An array of the same units and bins with two channels per cycle,
`year_sin` and `year_cos`, `day_sin` and `day_cos`, identical across
units. Combine it with the readings using
[`bind_channels()`](https://gillescolling.com/timesift/reference/bind_channels.md).
The channels are recorded as positions in the `position` attribute, and
the encoders of
[torch_learners](https://gillescolling.com/timesift/reference/torch_learners.md)
read them at their own amplitude rather than standardise them.

## Details

They are the time index of each bin, not a summary of the readings, so
adding them introduces no hand-built thermal feature: whatever a model
does with them it could have done with a calendar.

The position is read at the midpoint of the record each bin holds, in
UTC, so a bin the record only partly covers sits at the phase it was
actually measured over. A site's longitude and a zone's offset move the
day's phase by the same amount for every bin, which a model absorbs,
where a local clock's summer time would move it twice a year.
`inst/spec/representation.md` is the normative description.

## Examples

``` r
t <- seq(as.POSIXct("2021-09-01", tz = "UTC"), by = "hour", length.out = 24 * 400)
d <- data.frame(plot = "a", t = t, temp = sin(seq_along(t) / 500))
x <- grain_matrix(d, plot, t, temp, grain = "month")
round(calendar_channels(x)[1, 1:4, ], 3)

hourly <- grain_matrix(d, plot, t, temp, grain = "native")
round(calendar_channels(hourly, cycles = c("year", "day"))[1, 1:4, ], 3)
```
