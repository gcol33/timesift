# Reproduce the Schrankogel grid with timesift.
#
#   Rscript schrankogel.R <deposit_dir> <out_dir> [options]
#
# <deposit_dir> is the unpacked data directory of the Chytry et al. deposit
# (doi:10.5281/zenodo.17047026), holding logger_data.csv, spe_wide.csv, seasons.csv and
# output_temperature_variables_scaled.csv. Each of the four is checked against the size and the
# MD5 sum of the deposit's copy before it is read. <out_dir> receives one CSV per stage and a
# run.meta beside them saying what every file was computed on.
#
# Options, each --name=value:
#   --stages    which stages to run, comma-separated: contract, representation, baseline,
#               networks, selection, ensemble_selection, contrasts, grains, inflation. Default all
#               but networks, selection and ensemble_selection, the three that fit encoders.
#   --grains    which grains the network grid covers. Default day,week,month,season,year, the
#               five coarse grains; native and halfday are 26,304 and 2,192 steps per plot and
#               want a graphics processor, as they had in the study.
#   --learners  which encoders the network grid covers, plus `ensemble` for the eleven-member
#               set, whose members run as arms of their own and whose held-out predictions are
#               averaged into one further arm. Default cnn.
#   --baseline  which arms to fit: elastic_net on the deposit's 188 aggregated variables,
#               stepwise on the same, series for the penalised fit on the weekly coldest-day,
#               mean and warmest-day reading of the record itself, or several. Default
#               elastic_net. Forward selection over 188 columns is one glm fit per candidate
#               column per step per species per fold and takes many hours single-threaded.
#   --folds     a CSV of logger_ID and fold. Default folds.csv beside this script, the study's
#               own map, which is what every number below was checked against; `build` draws a
#               map with fold_map() instead, a different partition of the same design.
#   --inner     a CSV of outer_fold, logger_ID and inner_fold. Default inner_folds.csv beside
#               this script, the study's own inner partition of each outer training set, which
#               the selection stage chooses a candidate on; `build` deals five inner folds per
#               outer training set with fold_map() instead.
#   --epochs    epoch budget per network fit. Default 60, the budget the study used.
#   --seed      the training seed of the grid's encoders and of the selection's network. Default
#               1. The study refitted every cell of its grid under four seeds; a run per seed here
#               is how the package's own spread at a cell is read beside it. The ensemble's members
#               keep the seeds the paper's table gives them at seed 1, and move by `seed - 1` from
#               them at any other, so a run per seed is a refit of the ensemble too.
#   --threads   how many fits of one species' inner cross-validation the penalised arms run at
#               once. Default 1, serial. The path on every fitting plot and the path of each
#               inner fold are one independent fit each, so `--threads=6` is as many as five
#               inner folds can use and returns the same numbers one thread returns.
#   --smoke     `<outer folds>,<species>`, e.g. `1,4`. A smoke run: it names every file it writes
#               `smoke_`, records itself as a smoke run in run.meta, and makes no comparison
#               against the study's numbers. It exists to see the stages run before an overnight
#               one, and its output is not the reproduction.
#
# Outside a smoke run nothing here caps the data: a stage either runs over all 894 plots and all
# 101 species or it does not run.
