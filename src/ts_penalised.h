// The penalised fit, once, for both languages.
//
// An elastic net over a dense design, fitted by iteratively reweighted least squares with a
// cyclic coordinate descent inside it, along a path of penalties with a warm start at each step.
// The conventions are glmnet's, because the penalised arm is what the networks are measured
// against and a baseline that moves between the languages would make the tool the confound:
// weights normalised to sum to one, columns centred and scaled by their weighted mean and
// weighted standard deviation, the penalty path geometric from the smallest penalty that leaves
// every coefficient at zero, and the penalty chosen by cross-validated deviance.
//
// Everything here is plain arrays. The design is column-major, `x[i + j * n]`, which is what an
// R matrix already is and what a Fortran-ordered NumPy array already is.
