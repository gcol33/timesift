# One digest over every source the site is rendered from. build_site.R writes it into docs/ after
# a build, and the site workflow recomputes it from the checkout and fails the push whose docs/
# were built from other sources. The site is built locally, by a tool that post-processes the
# figures, and this is what holds the committed build to the sources it claims to render.
#
#   Rscript tools/site_digest.R            print the digest of the sources
#   Rscript tools/site_digest.R --write    write it to docs/site-digest.txt
#   Rscript tools/site_digest.R --check    compare docs/site-digest.txt with the sources
